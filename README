  Muticlycle Mips CPU (MMCPU)
  ---------------------------

  MMPCU is a very simple multicycle MIPS CPU simulator designed as programming
  exercise for classes on Computer Organizations. Students are required to
  complete the implementation with their own code.

  MMPU is based on "CPU MIPS Multiciclo" [1] by Prof. Paulo Sergio Lopes de
  Souza of ICMC - University of Sao Paulo.  Original code by Dr. Souza
  has been largely rewritten to accomodate changes in the project structure,
  Make build system, localization and a other changes.

  Instructions
  ---------------------------

  Students are required to complete the implementation of the simulator by
  editing the file code.c.

  In order to build the software:

  a) On Linux (of course)

  make

  b) On Windows (are you kidding, righ?)

  (Please, read the Makefile and figure it out).

  Bugs

  WARNING
  -------------------------------

  This code is in very alpha stage and it may be updated frequently
  during this period. If so happens, you may need to update your project.
  To that end, patches will be realased which you can safely apply
  to your own code (no API changes will take place in course of
  the discipline term).
